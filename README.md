### Loading Project

#### Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(_Language Used for the project_)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)(_For Scientific Computing_)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)(_For Data Analysis_)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)(_For Visualization_)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)(_For Visualization_)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)(_ML Library for training & testing data_)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Execution

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Iris_Flower_Classification` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook report.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```
or if you have 'Jupyter Lab' installed
```bash
jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter/iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
