### Data

#### Files

This project contains x files and y folder:

- `report.ipynb`: This is the main file where I have performed my work on the project.
- `result.csv`: The project dataset. I have loaded this data in the notebook..
- `export/` : Folder containing HTML and PDF version file of notebook.

### Loading Project

#### Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Execution

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Iris_Flower_Classification` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook report.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter/iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
